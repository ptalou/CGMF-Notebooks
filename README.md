# CGMF-Notebooks
A repository for all my IPython notebooks related to the CGMF code

CGMF is a Monte Carlo Hauser-Feshbach code that can be used to compute list-mode fission events. Each record correponds to a particular fission fragment, its kinetic energy, initial excitation energy, spin and parity, followed by the number, energies and angles of emitted prompt fission neutrons and gamma rays.
